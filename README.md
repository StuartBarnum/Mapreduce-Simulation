# Mapreduce-Simulation

An interesting set of exercises from Coursera's Data Manipulation at Scale, Systems and Algorithms. The idea is to use a Python class 
(as in object-oriented programming) to simulate the MapReduce environment (a version of computing in which large datasets are spread across
multiple machines). The class is defined in MayReduce.py. The other Python files are the implementations of MapReduce algorithms. For 
example, multiply.py implements multiplication of "sparse" matrices (useful in text analytics) in the MapReduce environment.
